For this challenge, we are given a zip file which is password protected.

We get this password by looking at the hint: 'What is mrT4ntr4's last name?'. 
A google for 'mrT4ntr4' gives us the twitter: https://twitter.com/mrt4ntr4, which has the last name required as the password to extract the zip.
We then try to open the .gif file.
There is an error so we open it using hexed.it.
This shows us that the file signature is incorrect for a gif file, so we replace the file header with the correct one and open the gif file.
The resulting image gives us the flag: infernoCTF{M3RRy_ChR1stmAs}
