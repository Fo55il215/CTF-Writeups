For this challenge, we are given a .mbox file, which, if you open it up in a text editor has a couple of emails.
In one of these emails, they say that they will post something on twitter, so we go to their account: https://twitter.com/imdeveloper123.

We then follow the link, but we get a message saying that it has been taken down, so we look at the page in the web archive which gives us the flag.
